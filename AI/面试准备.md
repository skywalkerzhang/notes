## 面试准备

1. Introduction

 it's a great honor for me to introduce myself to you. My name is Yue Zhang, and I have just finished my master of Science degree in UoM with dissertation. I got my bachelor degree in Zhejiang Normal University, major in computer science. During my undergraduate career, I've been top one student for 3 years and have won a number of scholarships and participated in school-level mathematical, algorithmic and software development competitions. During my Msc career, I've choice taking the AI course, and my msc project is ECG (Electrocardiograph) based on QRS Feature Disease Recognition.

2. Why UoM？ Why chose me as supervisor？

I went to Manchester for my postgraduate studies and I really liked the city. Compared to cities in China, it doesn't have a lot of entertainment and it's good for someone to focus on their studies within the school. Besides, I feel relaxed in this city. The most enjoyable thing in Manchester is going to the library in the morning, there are very few people on the way and I feel that the mental stress is slowly disappearing.



My supervisor in Manchester was Dave, who I respect very much, he was a patient and enthusiastic tutor and he told me that you are a very nice teacher. I have read some of your papers and I think that the project you are currently working on is very interesting cause I like projects that focused more on application and make a real difference to medicine today. It gives me a sense of achievement. And I have great confidence in Manchester's education and I think I would learn a lot if I had the opportunity to follow you.



5. Why chose to continue the career?

I love studying and I think it's purest at university, if I start working I have to think about starting a family and things like that and there will be all sorts of reasons that will affect my studies. I really enjoy the passionate discussions with a group of people about something, and I think PhD life gives me more of that.
