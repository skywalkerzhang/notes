### Physical Activity pre & post knee replacement ->  linkage of NHS and consumer health and fitness track data

* Data source: digital track from Mobile devices(eg. Fitbit、Google Fit、Strava)
* arthritis -> mobility ⬇ after surgery the mobility should ↑
* get the evidence of that
* state-of-art method:
  * questionnaires
  * accelerometry - different outcoming, 6 - 12 months after op
* Difficulties:
  * the scale of the data: we need 2 kinds of data. 1. normal people's digital tracks 2. the patients' tracks (interested group)
  * -> pre-trained model or traditional model
  * The criteria of the mobility? -- what is interested group really cared?



* aims:
  * literature review - know what the physical activity is?
  * qualitative study -- get info we need to focused on
  * get TKR data used to analyze
  * Examine patterns of activity -> good or bad? 



* what should I improve? The model to judge whether these patients mobility or how to collect useful data?

info :

1. app for rheumatoid arthritis: graphical form， patient input data

2. app store: 28 app to record the pain

3. Consumer Smartwatches -> TKR data： google, Huawei watch [weather & pain's relationship]

   answer these questions

   4. distance / step? they could suffer. how long they can stand? the number of steps

The KOALAP app collected sensor data on the inertial measurement unit (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) at 50 Hz, estimated pulse rate at 1 Hz, and barometer once per minute.

 such as extracting gravitational orientation vectors, computing dynamic body acceleration vectors, extracting properties of these vectors such as magnitude and direction, segmenting magnitude and direction vectors into behaviorally contiguous time regions, extracting a range of features from these regions,
and identifying regions that are most likely to correspond to gait or other behaviors implicated in pain aggravation. For these regions, measures of patterns of behavior relevant to patients with osteoarthritis can be estimated (eg, step count, time spent in sedentary behaviors, and time spent in motorized or other transport activities). 



【疼痛级别 —— 量化疼痛 RNS】 signal of pain -- threshold -- EEG？
